      <h2>Spanish for beginners</h2>
      <p>
I am specialized in new learners. The language is transmitted through practical examples with active participation of the learners in order to assimilate in a global way the words, the grammatical or phonetic rules according to their uses and in a usual context, ranging from an informal language to a form written complex. Classes are built around oral communication to enhance the interactivity of learners.<a name="aboutme"></a><br>
